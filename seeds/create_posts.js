Even from the very beginning of the trip, things like teaching them how to hold our perfect kid sized paddles to how to sit in the raft are moments of excitement.  Some kids are nervous and other are full of anticipation.  One thing is for sure, as the day progresses and we hit the whitewater, the pure thrill of adventure can be seen in their eyes",
